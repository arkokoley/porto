title: Virtual Stock Guru
description: >
  Virtual Stock Guru is a virtual stock trading game. This game pulls in the latest stock values of various companies listed on and NSE and NYSE and let users trade on them with Virtual Cash.

  It’s a good simulation platform to let users test on their stock market skills without actually investing real money.

  We had a public run of this game as a part of our College fest (Spandan) and got about 1.5 lakh hits.

  Currently we are working on gamifying it further to make it available for public use. It’s currently deployed at https://vstock.guru
